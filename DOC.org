* HOW TO USE

This tool uploads your content to GitHub using a single command.

There is nothing complicated to learn. GitPush is designed to be very simple to use.  
All you need is a basic understanding of how git works.

It is not compulsory to learn all git commands. While using GitPush, you will not necessarily need to know every git command, but it is *highly recommended* that you understand the basics of git and how it works internally.

If you do not know all git commands, do not worry — GitPush abstracts most of them for you.

To see all available commands and options, use:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
gitpush -h
# or
gitpush --help
#+END_SRC

* Commands and Uses

Before using GitPush, you must have a git repository.  
Since GitPush is a git-based tool, you need to:

- Create a GitHub repository
- Clone it to your local system

You should already know how to create and clone a repository.

** 1. Clone and enter your repository

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Suppose your GitHub username is "username"
# and your repository name is "test"

git clone https://github.com/username/test.git

# A folder named "test" will be created
cd test

# You are now inside your repository
#+END_SRC

** 2. Using GitPush inside a repository

You are free to use normal git commands if you want, but GitPush automates the common workflow using a single command.

** 3. View available options

Inside your git repository, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
gitpush -h
#+END_SRC

This will show the list of available options.

** 4. Make changes to your repository

Modify your files as needed:
- Add files
- Edit files
- Delete files
- Any other changes

** 5. Push all changes using a single command

To upload all changes to GitHub, simply run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
gitpush
#+END_SRC

This command will:
- Show git status
- Add all changes
- Commit with a default message
- Push to GitHub

You can visit GitHub to confirm your changes.

Git may ask for your *username* and *password* (or token) to verify your identity.

** 6. Using file-specific mode

To upload a specific file instead of all changes, use:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
gitpush -f
#+END_SRC

Steps:
- You will be prompted to enter the filename:
  =Enter filename:=
- Enter the filename and press Enter
- You will be asked whether you want to change the default commit message

Default commit message format:
=Updated on [Date] at [Time]=

- Press =y= to change the message
- Press =n= or Enter to keep the default
- If you choose to change it, enter your custom commit message
- GitPush will commit and push your changes

** 7. Authentication

At the end, git will ask for your GitHub credentials to confirm your identity.

* Interactive Mode (New)

GitPush now provides an *interactive menu-based mode* for better control and ease of use.

To start interactive mode, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
gitpush -i
#+END_SRC

This opens a command-line interactive interface where you can perform git operations step by step.

** Main Interactive Menu

When interactive mode starts, you will see the following options:

- Git Status
- Add Files
- Commit
- Push
- Pull
- Branch Operations
- Log
- Exit

Each option can be selected by entering the corresponding number.

** Git Status

Shows the current status of your repository using:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git status
#+END_SRC

** Add Files

Provides multiple ways to stage files:

- Add all files
- Add only modified files
- Add only untracked files
- Manually select files from a list

Manual selection allows you to pick files one by one from the repository status.

** Commit

- Displays the current staged changes
- Uses a default commit message based on date and time
- Allows you to change the commit message interactively
- Prevents committing if no files are staged

** Push

Pushes committed changes to the remote repository.

** Pull

Fetches and merges changes from the remote repository.

** Branch Operations

Allows you to:

- List branches
- Switch between branches
- Create a new branch
- Delete an existing branch

** Log

Displays a formatted git log showing:
- Commit history
- Branches
- Graph structure

** Exit

Exits interactive mode safely.

* When to Use Which Mode

- Use *default mode* (=gitpush=) for quick daily pushes
- Use *interactive mode* (=gitpush -i=) when you need:
  - Selective staging
  - Branch management
  - Controlled commits
  - Better visibility of repository state

* Enjoy!

GitPush is designed to make git usage faster, safer, and simpler — especially when working from the terminal.
